# Enhanced Admin Grids
## Version 1.0.0 (work-in-progress)

_This version is a work-in-progress, it is strictly for testing purposes, unless you know what you are doing._

More informations about the extension can be found on its Magento Connect page here : https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/enhanced-admin-grids-editor.html.

### Backwards compatibility
Due to the code refactoring, any custom development based on classes coming from the previous versions of the extension, or using an own `customgrid.xml` file, may certainly not be compatible as-is with the new version. Please review the changes and adapt your code accordingly before using the new version on a live environment.

_Backwards compatibility is assured for all the previously existing data. **If you're upgrading from a previous version, flushing the cache storage is likely to be needed to ensure that everything works fine (due to some renamings in the database structure).**_

### Main changes / New features :
- massive code refactoring (goals: better maintainability, more consistency, better practices and a smaller footprint)
- big design and usability rework
- every in-grid customization is now saved via Ajax, for a seamless integration in Ajax-based grids
- profiles system (different columns lists and default parameters for each grid, assignable to different roles)
- forcable grid types (use advanced features for the grids that you know to be compatible with a given grid type, but by default are not associated to it)
- advanced filtering possibilities for text, options and country columns (except for the original grid columns, as for the rest)
- forms in configuration windows are now split in multiple collapsible fieldsets
- failed block verifications for custom columns are not blocking anymore (by default)
- refined permissions
- various bug fixes

### Final steps before beta release
- [ ] last waves of code refactoring/cleanup and complexity reduction (focus on [Scrutinizer hot spots](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/mage-eag/mage-enhanced-admin-grids/code-structure/1.0.0-wip/hot-spots))
- [ ] **editor system refactoring** :
    - [ ] separate responsibilities into different models, introduce callbacks **(available in the [edge branch](https://github.com/mage-eag/mage-enhanced-admin-grids/tree/1.0.0-wip-edge))**
    - [ ] implement custom columns editability **(available in the [edge branch](https://github.com/mage-eag/mage-enhanced-admin-grids/tree/1.0.0-wip-edge))**
    - [ ] implement order address columns editability **(available in the [edge branch](https://github.com/mage-eag/mage-enhanced-admin-grids/tree/1.0.0-wip-edge))**
    - [ ] implement inventory columns editability **(available in the [edge branch](https://github.com/mage-eag/mage-enhanced-admin-grids/tree/1.0.0-wip-edge))**
    - [ ] create a spreadsheet summarizing the compatibility of each editor across the different Magento versions (use three different states : "untested", "tested and functional", "tested with problems" - provide links to the related issues -)
    - [ ] start filling up the compatibility spreadsheet
- [ ] **JS code refactoring** :
    - [ ] remove `CDATA` sections
    - [ ] refactor and optimize code when possible
    - [ ] review the code style (follow some best practices)
    - [ ] ~~write comments (use [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/index.html))~~ **(probably not worth the time)**
    - [ ] implement an object manager, to remove as much clutter as possible from the global scope, and automatically cleanup unneeded/overridable objects (especially for Ajax grids)
- [ ] move the columns list form to dedicated window, as for the other forms (avoid cluttering any external wrapping form with a lot of parameters) **(available in the [edge branch](https://github.com/mage-eag/mage-enhanced-admin-grids/tree/1.0.0-wip-edge))**
- [ ] rework the profiles bar so that the number of displayed profiles is adapted to the available width **(available in the [edge branch](https://github.com/mage-eag/mage-enhanced-admin-grids/tree/1.0.0-wip-edge))**
- [ ] rework the "Access All" profiles permission (make all the profiles be available from everywhere, except in the bar)
- [ ] ~~rework the sales items columns (implement the advanced text filter, improve their extensibility, and allow to display a customizable value when exported)~~ **(later)**

### Continuous changes (primary todo list)
- write a FAQ page with the most common issues and questions
- new custom columns for different grids (especially the sales grids)
- better compatibility with certain grids
- various small improvements

### Other considered changes (secondary todo list)
- profiles groups ?
- start writing some tests (better late than never)
